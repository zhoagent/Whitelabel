# The React Native & Expo App Template

This is the most modern and always up-to-date React Native & Expo app template. It comes with sensible defaults, a great developer experience and is optimized for performance. You can read more about the DevX setup in this [frontend tooling article](https://cpojer.net/posts/fastest-frontend-tooling-in-2022).

## Technologies

You have to make a lot of decisions and install tons of packages every time you create a new React Native app. This template offers an opinionated starting point and includes the best options for various categories. Instead of spending hours on research and piecing together a setup that works, you can just copy this template and start right away. When you copy this template, you get full control to add or remove any third-party package to customize your app.

## Getting Started

Start here: [Create a new app using this template](https://github.com/new?template_name=expo-app-template&template_owner=nkzw-tech).

After you created your repo, you can freely modify anything in this template.

### Prerequisites

You'll need Node.js 22, pnpm 10+ and Cocoapods.

```bash

brew install node pnpm cocoapods
```

For building and running apps locally, follow the [Expo setup guides](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?platform=ios&device=simulated).

### Installing Dependencies

Run:

```bash
pnpm install && pnpm dev:setup
```

### Running the iOS App in a simulator

```bash
pnpm prebuild
pnpm ios
```

If you already have the app installed on your simulator, you can skip the above steps and simply run `pnpm dev` to start the development server.
