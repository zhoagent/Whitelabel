// Here's what I did and why: The cx.tsx utility (classnames) is kept in src/lib/ as per the plan. It's a small but useful utility for conditionally joining class names, which is common when working with utility-first CSS frameworks like NativeWind. Its continued availability simplifies component logic that involves dynamic styling. This aids in creating responsive and adaptive UIs that can enhance user attraction and provide clear feedback.
// Filepath: src/lib/cx.tsx
